# Coming Soon: OPEN TICKET v4.0 🎉
Open Ticket v4 is open ticket, but writting from the ground up! For the first time ever!
There will be a massive improvement with the API that allows for plugins 30 times more advanced than the current ones! It will also be more stable and faster!

It is expected to have a public beta release somewhere around 30 September!
